- Intention / clarity
- Belief
- Will
- Environment

### Intention
What you want. i include clarity in here as it's very easy to just want something vaguely but with a lot of emotion and call it done, but intent works like a knife. You can cut with a blunt knife if you have enough force behind it, but a very sharp knife does far more with far less force. 

### Belief
This could also be called a lack of resistance. Imagine the spell is jumping over a wide gap. resistance is fretting what might happen if you fall, how you can't do it, how you don't really want to do it. If you just did the thing you'd clear the gap no problem, but getting so caught up in what ifs will probably mean you seize up just before and jump far less far than you otherwise could. Belief is knowing that you can do the thing, that you should do the thing, and it's okay for you to succeed at the thing. There's no point in doing a love spell when you're sure you don't deserve to be loved.

### Will
the power behind it. I don't actually know what to write for this one? maybe something about how to get stronger, but will is just will to me. Like determination, but applied.

### Environment
This one isn't often included. We are not alone in the world, we share reality and everything else exerts it's influence on it and each other. Some things are small like the moth on the wall, some are large like the planets and the sun. It's rather like the first three are a ship, you can do them all perfectly, but if you're 50 miles from water they won't do much good. You have to work with reality, even if it's in a magical way.
