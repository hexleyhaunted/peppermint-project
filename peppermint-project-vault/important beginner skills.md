I feel like these are the basic skills that anyone can develop from nothing and that form a foundation for everything else.
you need to be able to sense what youre doing, talk to things and listen to them to gain knowledge from the source. have a community to ask questions of and to help when you get into trouble and to be able to work on your emotional health so you can heal from mistake and do magic for the right reasons not to fill some void.

- plant watching
- being still (sdsu)
- feeling your emotions/body
