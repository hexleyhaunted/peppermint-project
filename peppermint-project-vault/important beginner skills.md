I feel like these are the basic skills that anyone can develop from nothing and that form a foundation for everything else.
you need to be able to sense what you're doing, talk to things and listen to them to gain knowledge from the source. have a community to ask questions of and to help when you get into trouble and to be able to work on your emotional health so you can heal from mistake and do magic for the right reasons not to fill some void.

- plant watching
- being still (sdsu) (I might reframe this as meditation since apparently catas are hard mode meditation)
- feeling your emotions/body (and learning how to name those feelings)
- communicating with things
- finding a community
- working out what to believe
- shadow work (is this *really* a beginner skill)
- tarot (general divination)

- journaling
	- write down your feelings and your magical experiences.  forgetting is easy, but if you write it down and forget later then you still have them.
	- typing is okay, but do *some* writing.  typing and writing light up different parts of the brain, in different ways, and handwriting innately has a more magical connection, like drawing, as a physical expression of thought
- will development exercises
	- silly, arbitrary decisions, that you decide to do and *stick with doing*.
	- so, so much of magic is *choice* and deciding to stick with the choices that you make because they define your purpose.  so practice making choices and being consistent with them in ways that don't matter before the ways that do matter show up
- politeness/boundaries
	- it's okay to decline if something approaches you
	- it's okay to ask something to leave your house if it shows up uninvited
- wards and basic protections
- understanding your unique semiotic map
- connecting with the land (go out & pick up trash)
