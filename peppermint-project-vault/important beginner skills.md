I feel like these are the basic skills that anyone can develop from nothing and that form a foundation for everything else.
you need to be able to sense what you're doing, talk to things and listen to them to gain knowledge from the source. have a community to ask questions of and to help when you get into trouble and to be able to work on your emotional health so you can heal from mistake and do magic for the right reasons not to fill some void.

- plant watching
- being still (sdsu) (I might reframe this as meditation since apparently catas are hard mode meditation) [^2]
- feeling your emotions/body (and learning how to name those feelings)
- communicating with things
- finding a community
- working out what to believe
- shadow work (is this *really* a beginner skill) [^1]
- tarot (general divination)

- journalling
	- write down your feelings and your magical experiences.  forgetting is easy, but if you write it down and forget later then you still have them.
	- typing is okay, but do *some* writing.  typing and writing light up different parts of the brain, in different ways, and handwriting innately has a more magical connection, like drawing, as a physical expression of thought
- will development exercises
	- silly, arbitrary decisions, that you decide to do and *stick with doing*.
	- so, so much of magic is *choice* and deciding to stick with the choices that you make because they define your purpose.  so practice making choices and being consistent with them in ways that don't matter before the ways that do matter show up
- politeness/boundaries
	- it's okay to decline if something approaches you
	- it's okay to ask something to leave your house if it shows up uninvited
- wards and basic protections
- understanding your unique semiotic map
- connecting with the land (go out & pick up trash)

[^1]: I'd argue shadow work is a beginner skill as much as meditation is. Self awareness is a skill, to know why you're doing something and where certain beliefs and feeling come from. it makes you less toxic as a practitioner, less reckless and it makes you harder to manipulate

[^2]: I suppose in general for beginners I'd phrase it as two kinds of meditation. one is taking the time to notice what thoughts you have. and if something is worrying you to take the time to sit and think it through. The other kind is to be in the moment, to not give attention to the thoughts and to be as much as possible.

I think it's important to emphasis trying new things as everyone has different tools and practices that click with them. It's important to cover the main areas, but to say that you should try divination but inside of that have a play around with dowsing and tarot and teal leaves and bones and see what speaks to you. Same with self care. some people like to sit with thoughts, some people like journalling, some people like a long quiet walk in the woods. It seems best to say what the intent is behind them and that you should find a way to do that that works best for you, and here are a few ideas.
