how 2
1. find a place of stillness
2. feel your awareness
3. spread it out from you in every direction you can conceive of, even ones that aren't real, like a spider at the centre of a web, feeling for vibrations
4. record your impressions no matter how small or weird as they come up
	- talking calmly into a voice note or taking some brief handwritten notes
5. take your impressions seriously.

one of the most important things you can do as a mage is trust your senses, even and sometimes especially if nobody else does.
